<h1>SKYLAR</h1>
<h2>Hi everyone! I am currently student in the Girls Who Code </h2>
<h2> Summer Immersion Program which is hosted by Ford! </h2>
<h2> When I am not playing water polo or tanning at the beach,</h2>
<h2> I am binge watching Pretty Little liars (my favorite show),</h2>
<h2>indulging on some French macarons (my absolute favorite food),</h2>
<h2> or jamming out to some J Cole.</h2>
<h2> You will almost always find me at the pool, beach, or at hot yoga</h2>
